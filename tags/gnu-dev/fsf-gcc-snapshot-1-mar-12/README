		OpenRISC Development GNU Tool Chain Repository
		==============================================

This directory is where you will find all the source trees for the development
version of the GNU tool chain. The newlib library is included, since that is
required for GCC testing. The code in this directory should be functional, but
is not considered stable.

Note that the Linux tool chain requires uClibc and Linux, which should be
downloaded using git.

Stable release source trees are found in the gdb-src directory.

The file structure mirrors that of the main Free Software Foundation
repository. There are two main directories:

  "or1k-src" mirrors the upstream src directory and contains the code for
  CGEN, binutils, newlib, gdb and associated libraries.

  "or1k-gcc" mirrors the upstream gcc directory and contains the code for gcc
  and its associated libraries.

The tool chains (or1k-elf for bare metal and or1k-linux-uclibc for Linux
applications) are built using a source tree, combining these two
directories.

Three scripts are provided

  "bld-elf.sh" to build the newlib tool chain
  "bld-linux-uclibc.sh" to build the uClibc tool chain
  "bld-all.sh" to build both tool chains

By default the tests (which require DejaGnu to be installed) are *not* run.

Any questions should be posted on the OpenRISC forum at
opencores.org/forum,OpenRISC, or discussed on IRC at freenode.net, channel
#opencores.
