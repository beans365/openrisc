	* includes/or_debug_proxy.h: <no_cpu>: Adding extern definition.
	* src/linux_usb_driver_calls.c: Added debugging output.
	(init_usb_jtag): Put in device name listing code. Device open now
	uses these identification strings instead of the hardcoded one.
	* src/usb_functions.c: 
	(usb_dbg_test): Added better debugging output.
	* src/FT2232c.cpp: Added debugging output.
	* src/or_debug_proxy.c: <no_cpu>: Global variable added to determine
	if we should initialise CPU on connecting or not.
	(main): New option added, -b, to use proxy in bus-only mode, where it
	does not initialise CPU and just provides bus access.
	* src/gdb.c: 
	(gdb_set_chain): Check if no_cpu is set, if so, don't allow setting
	of scan chain to CPU.
	(set_stall_state): Check if no_cpu is set, if so, don't allow setting
	of stall bit to CPU.
	* Makefile: Change STATIC_LIB back to explicitly require the driver
	library version 0.4.16.
	* README: Updated with information on new driver problems.
	
2011-03-07  Julius Baxter, ORSoC AB <julius@orsoc.se>
	* Makefile:(STATIC_LDFLAGS): Added -lrt as required by new libftd2xx.
	Updated example of downloading static library.
	* README: Updated to contain information about latest FTDI libftd2xx
	drivers.

2011-03-07  Julius Baxter, ORSoC AB <julius@orsoc.se>
	* src/or_debug_proxy.c: Ran indent on code to neaten.
	Added -k option to enable kernel debugging option which remaps 0xc0 
	high address to 0x00.
	* include/gdb.h:(kernel_debug): Declared as extern int.
	* src/gdb.c: Ran indent on code to neaten.
	(kernel_debug): Added, initialise to 0.
	<gdb_write_byte>: Also check kernel_debug with IS_VM_ADDR.
	<gdb_read_byte>: Ditto.
	<gdb_write_reg>: Ditto.
	<gdb_read_reg>: Ditto.
	<gdb_read_block>: Ditto.
	<gdb_write_block>: Ditto.

	* src/gdb.c <rsp_query>: qTStatus packet now returns empty packet.
	
2010-09-24  Julius Baxter  <julius@opencores.org>

	* ChangeLog: Created.
	* src/or_debug_proxy.c: Removed all VPI endpoint options.
	* src/gdb.c: Added rsp_query handlers for various new packets seen 
	             with gdb-7.2.
