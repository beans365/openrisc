			  OpenRISC GNU Tool Patches
			  =========================

To reduce bandwidth, OpenRISC GNU tool chain source is provided as patches to
the standard GNU tool distributions.

This directory is where you will find all the patches for the standard GNU
tool chain. The newlib library is included, since that is required for GCC
testing.

Any questions should be posted on the OpenRISC forum at
opencores.org/forum,OpenRISC.
