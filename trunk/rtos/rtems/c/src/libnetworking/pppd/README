This directory contains a port of ppp-2.3.5.  The official site for 
the original source for this PPP implementation is:

ftp://cs.anu.edu.au/pub/software/ppp

NOTE:  As of 11/30/1999, the current version of this source is 2.3.10.

The port was performed by Tomasz Domin <dot@comarch.pl> of ComArch SA
and has only been tested on the mpc823.  The modem driver should 
work with minor modifications on other systems.
=================================================================
Some comments:

+ "SetStatusInfo is a function which displays given message on 
  bottom side of the screen."

  The issue of how to deal with SetStatusInfo in a generic, portable
  fashion is still open.

+ "Dialer returns positive integer when an error occurs, and negative one
  which is parsed from modem aswer, when connection is done (for example
  -28000 if connection speed is 28000 baud ...)"

+   PPP_User/PPP_Password
   "When this field is set, it is sent to the server when there is need
   to login ....
   When it is blank - it is using other method of authentification ... or
   none ...
   PPP_Password is also used in CHAT and PAP  - because there is no
   configuration files in RTEMS ..."

   This falls into the general question of how to generally configure this.

+ ConnectionStatus

  This is the method of synchronization between pppd task and others.
  ConnectionStatus field is set by pppd - when connection occurs it`s state
  is set to Connected. WantConnection is set by client application (and
  the appriopriate event is sent then) so pppd knows what user wants to do ...

+ Around line 270 of main.c, there is code to change the default
  nameserver... why?

  Becouse in my application user can change it anytime  ... - without need of
  rebooting the system
  When PPP connection is configured there is needed additional info about
  nameservers - PPP layer cant discover them itself
