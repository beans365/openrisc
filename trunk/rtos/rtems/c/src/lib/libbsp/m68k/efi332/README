Description: efi68k
============
CPU: MC68332 @20MHz
RAM: 256k max. (supports several configurations)
ROM: 512k (supports several configurations)

   This general purpose controller has been designed by a group of
Internet subscribes to the mailing list "efi332" (an offshoot of the
"diy_efi" mailing list). Although efi332 was initially designed for
automotive research, it is a fairly generalized embedded controller
when used without the companion EFI I/O board, and is patterned much
after the the Motorola BCC. A 4x3 inch (approx.) printed circuit board
is available (about $14US). For complete information see

	http://www.diy-efi.org

TODO:
=====
- integrate the interrupt driven stdin/stdout into RTEMS to (a) reduce
  the interrupt priority and (2) to prevent it from blocking.
- add a timer driver for the tmtest set.
