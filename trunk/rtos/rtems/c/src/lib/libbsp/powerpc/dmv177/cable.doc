Background
==========

All serial cables described in this file were built using RJ-45 ribbon
cables which were plugged into DB-25 or DB-9 adapters wired as described.
Matching the colors of the wires in the shell is the easiest way to 
make sure the cable is built properly.

The board is configured as follows:

  - An MC68681 is the first two serial ports.  These are RS-232 and may
    be accessed via the front panel or the P2.  The front panel connector
    has both A and B serial ports on a single connector. DY-4 part number
    "OBYC3ASSY901132-000 Rev-" brings these ports out to two DB-25 
    female connectors.

  - The MC68681 serial ports are also accessible on the P2 connector.
    DY-4 part number "OBYC3ASSY901080-004 Rev A" brings these out
    to DB-9 female connectors.  These were not used in this effort.

  - A Z85C30 is used for the third and fourth serial ports.  These are
    RS-422 and may only be accessed via the P2 connector.  These are
    brought out to DB-25 male connectors.  An RS-422 to RS-232 converter
    was used to interface with these serial ports.

RS-422 Converter
================

An RS-422 to RS-232 converter from B&B Electronics was used to
adapt the RS-422 signals so they could be used with a normal
RS-232 serial port.  Here is the information required to purchase
one of these:

    RS-232/RS-422 Converter:     Model 422LCON
    Power Supply:                Model 422PS

RS-422 Connection to a PC
=========================

This requires two cables with the converter connecting them.
