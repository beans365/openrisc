 *  This file manages the interval timer on the PowerPC MPC821.
 *  NOTE: This is not the PIT, but rather the RTEMS interval

 *  We shall use the bottom 32 bits of the timebase register,

 *  The following was in the 403 version of this file. I don't
 *  know what it means. JTM 5/19/98
 *  NOTE: It is important that the timer start/stop overhead be
 *        determined when porting or modifying this code.
