The RTEMS project uses Intel x86 based computers running the RedHat
distribution of the Linux operating system internally for development.  
This release has been tested on the following Languages/CPUs/Targets using
RedHat Linux 5.1 as the host environment:

NOTES:

"NOT TESTED" indicates that this was not tested in the testing cycle
immediately preceding the snapshot.

(1) Target board is not owned by RTEMS Project.  The target is known
    to compile and link with all appropriate tests successfully.
    If the target does not support multiprocessor configurations, then
    "ALL TESTS" does not include the multiprocessor tests.

(2) RTEMS Project cannot internally compile or test this target.
    The HP-UX is not recognized in the configure script.
    The a29k does not use GNU tools and may suffer from bit rot.

(3) Target is not intended to be executed.  It is only an example.

(4) The board owned by the RTEMS Project is broken.  The BSP is known
    to compile and link with all appropriate tests successfully.

(5) This BSP is tested on a CPU software simulator.

(6) This BSP was tested by an RTEMS volunteer and reported to work.

(7) The BSP is deprecated.  For information on what would be 
    required to update it contact rtems@OARcorp.com.

(8) The Radstone ppcn_60x BSP was written by Radstone and designed
    to support any Radstone PowerPC board with only minor modifications.

(9) This CPU model is supported but there are no BSPs using this CPU
    model included in the current distribution.
