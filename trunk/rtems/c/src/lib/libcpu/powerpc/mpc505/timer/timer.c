/*  timer.c
 *
 *  This file manages the benchmark timer used by the RTEMS Timing Test
 *  Suite.  Each measured time period is demarcated by calls to
 *  Timer_initialize() and Read_timer().  Read_timer() usually returns
 *  the number of microseconds since Timer_initialize() exitted.
 *
 *  NOTE: It is important that the timer start/stop overhead be
 *        determined when porting or modifying this code.
