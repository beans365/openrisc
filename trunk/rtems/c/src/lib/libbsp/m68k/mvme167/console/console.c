/*
 *  console.c
 *
 *  This file contains the MVME167 termios console package. Only asynchronous
 *  I/O is supported.
 *
 *  /dev/tty0 is channel 0, Serial Port 1/Console on the MVME712M.
 *  /dev/tty1 is channel 1, Serial Port 2/TTY01 on the MVME712M.
 *  /dev/tty2 is channel 2, Serial Port 3 on the MVME712M.
 *  /dev/tty3 is channel 3, Serial Port 4 on the MVME712M.
 *
 *  Normal I/O uses DMA for output, interrupts for input. /dev/console is
 *  fixed to be /dev/tty01, Serial Port 2. Very limited support is provided
 *  for polled I/O. Polled I/O is intended only for running the RTEMS test
 *  suites. In all cases, Serial Port 1/Console is allocated to 167Bug and
 *  is the dedicated debugger port. We configure GDB to use 167Bug for
 *  debugging. When debugging with GDB or 167Bug, do not open /dev/tty00.
 *
 *  Modern I/O chips often contain a number of I/O devices that can operate
 *  almost independently of each other. Typically, in RTEMS, all devices in
 *  an I/O chip are handled by a single device driver, but that need not be
 *  always the case. Each device driver must supply six entry points in the
 *  Device Driver Table: a device initialization function, as well as an open,
 *  close, read, write and a control function. RTEMS assigns a device major
 *  number to each device driver. This major device number is the index of the
 *  device driver entries in the Device Driver Table, and it used to identify
 *  a particular device driver. To distinguish multiple I/O sub-devices within
 *  an I/O chip, RTEMS supports device minor numbers. When a I/O device is
 *  initialized, the major number is supplied to the initialization function.
 *  That function must register each sub-device with a separate name and minor
 *  number (as well as the supplied major number). When an application opens a
 *  device by name, the corresponding major and minor numbers are returned to
 *  the caller to be used in subsequent I/O operations (although these details
 *  are typically hidden within the library functions).
 *
 *  Such a scheme recognizes that the initialization of the individual
 *  sub-devices is generally not completely independent. For example, the
 *  four serial ports of the CD2401 can be configured almost independently
 *  from each other. One port could be configured to operate in asynchronous
 *  mode with interrupt-driven I/O, while another port could be configured to
 *  operate in HDLC mode with DMA I/O. However, a device reset command will
 *  reset all four channels, and the width of DMA transfers and the number of
 *  retries following bus errors selected applies to all four channels.
 *  Consequently, when initializing one channel, one must be careful not to
 *  destroy the configuration of other channels that are already configured.
 *
 *  One problem with the RTEMS I/O initialization model is that no information
 *  other than a device major number is passed to the initialization function.
 *  Consequently, the sub-devices must be initialized with some pre-determined
 *  configuration. To change the configuration of a sub-device, it is
 *  necessary to either rewrite the initialization function, or to make a
 *  series of rtems_io_control() calls after initialization. The first
 *  approach is not very elegant. The second approach is acceptable if an
 *  application is simply changing baud rates, parity or other such
 *  asynchronous parameters (as supplied by the termios package). But what if
 *  an application requires one channel to run in HDLC or Bisync mode and
 *  another in async mode? With a single driver per I/O chip approach, the
 *  device driver must support multiple protocols. This is feasible, but it
 *  often means that an application that only does asynchronous I/O now links
 *  in code for other unused protocols, thus wasting precious ROM space.
 *  Worse, it requires that the sub-devices be initialized in some
 *  configuration, and that configuration then changed through a series of
 *  device driver control calls. There is no standard API in RTEMS to switch
 *  a serial line to some synchronous protocol.
 *
 *  A better approach is to treat each channel as a separate device, each with
 *  its own device device driver. The application then supplies its own device
 *  driver table with only the required protocols (drivers) on each line. The
 *  problem with this approach is that the device drivers are not really
 *  independent, given that the I/O sub-devices within a common chip are not
 *  independent themselves. Consequently, the related device drivers must
 *  share some information. In RTEMS, there is no standard location in which
 *  to share information.
 *
 *  This driver handles all four channels, i.e. it distinguishes the
 *  sub-devices using minor device numbers. Only asynchronous I/O is
 *  supported. The console is currently fixed to be channel 1 on the CD2401,
 *  which corresponds to the TTY01 port (Serial Port 2) on the MVME712M
 *  Transition Module.
 *
 *  The CD2401 does either interrupt-driven or DMA I/O; it does not support
 *  polling. In interrupt-driven or DMA I/O modes, interrupts from the CD2401
 *  are routed to the MC68040, and the processor generates an interrupt
 *  acknowledge cycle directly to the CD2401 to obtain an interrupt vector.
 *  The PCCchip2 supports a pseudo-polling mode in which interrupts from the
 *  CD2401 are not routed to the MC68040, but can be detected by the processor
 *  by reading the appropriate CD2401 registers. In this mode, interrupt
 *  acknowledge cycles must be generated to the CD2401 by reading the
 *  appropriate PCCchip2 registers.
 *
 *  Interrupts from the four channels cannot be routed independently; either
 *  all channels are used in the pseudo-polling mode, or all channels are used
 *  in interrupt-driven/DMA mode. There is no advantage in using the speudo-
 *  polling mode. Consenquently, this driver performs DMA input and output.
 *  Output is performed directly from the termios raw output buffer, while
 *  input is accumulated into a separate buffer.
 *
 *  THIS MODULE IS NOT RE-ENTRANT! Simultaneous access to a device from
 *  multiple tasks is likely to cause significant problems! Concurrency
 *  control is implemented in the termios package.
 *
 *  THE INTERRUPT LEVEL IS SET TO 1 FOR ALL CHANNELS.
 *  If the CD2401 is to be used for high speed synchronous serial I/O, the
 *  interrupt priority might need to be increased.
 *
 *  ALL INTERRUPT HANDLERS ARE SHARED.
 *  When adding extra device drivers, either rewrite the interrupt handlers
 *  to demultiplex the interrupts, or install separate vectors. Common vectors
 *  are currently used to catch spurious interrupts. We could already have
 *  installed separate vectors for each channel and used the spurious
 *  interrupt handler defined in some other BSPs, but handling spurious
 *  interrupts from the CD2401 in this device driver allows us to record more
 *  information on the source of the interrupts. Furthermore, we have observed
 *  the occasional spurious interrupt from channel 0. We definitely do not
 *  to call a debugger for those.
