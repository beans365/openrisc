Overall, this code should still be considered in its early stages.  It
works but has some distance to go before it is fully documented and 
easily configurable.

+ Compare the code to the original 2.3.5 and eliminate spurious changes.

+ Update the code to 2.3.10.

+ Eliminate items specific to Tomasz' system.  In particular, the
  code reports status and gets configuration information in a system
  specific manner.   main.c is particularly guilty of this although
  other files suffer from this also.

+ Find comments in Polish and get Tomasz to translate them. :)

+ Add netdemo showing configuration and initialization.

+ Get feature list.

+ Document dialer setup.

+ Only modem driver is system specific so there is the possibility
  that shareable code exists in it.
