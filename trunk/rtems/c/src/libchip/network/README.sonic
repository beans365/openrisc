This SONIC driver does not make any attempt to support the SONIC chip
in any of the following modes:

  + 16-bit
  + little endian
  
It does not attempt to handle SONIC's older than Revision C.  There is
a bug in chips before that revision that must be handled in the driver.

The configuration table should be discussed here but if you look in the
include file for the sonic, it is reasonably obvious. :)

The performance impact of transforming this driver into libchip format
was minimal.

The powerpc/dmv177 BSP uses this driver and can serve as an example 
configuration table.
