			 OpenRISC GDB Implementation
			 ===========================

GDB Patches Directory
=====================

This directory contains patch files for GDB for the OpenRISC architecture.

These patch files should be applied to the standard GNU GDB implementation of
corresponding version. For example if the standard implementation of GDB has
been unpacked in gdb-6.8 and the patch file is in or32-gdb-6.8-patch-2.1.bz2,
use:

  cd gdb-6.8
  bunzip2 -dc ../or32-gdb-6.8-patch-2.1.bz2 | patch -p1

The directory gdb-6.8 will not contain a source tree for GDB 6.8 for the
OpenRISC architecture. It can be built using the standard GDB instructions
(configure; make; make install).
