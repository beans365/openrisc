		  OpenRISC Unified GNU Tool Chain Repository
		  ==========================================

This directory is where you will find all the source trees for the standard
GNU tool chain. The newlib library is included, since that is required for GCC
testing.

The structure mirrors that of the main Free Software Foundation repository.

Using a unified directory means that the entire tool chain can be built in a
single pass. The script "bld.sh" will build a unified source tree in the a
directory (default name "srcw") and then build and install all the tools using
a separate build directory (default "bld-or32"). The default install directory
is "/opt/or32-elf-new").

Use "./bld.sh --help" to check the options available, which includes options
to change all the default directories and to omit any of the phases of the
build process (linking, configuring, building,installing).

Note in particular that the script requires a version of Or1ksim built from
SVN (not Or1ksim 0.4.0 release) and that the --or1ksim parameter should be
used to point to the directory where or1ksim is installed (default
/opt/or1ksim-new).

Any questions should be posted on the OpenRISC forum at
opencores.org/forum,OpenRISC.
