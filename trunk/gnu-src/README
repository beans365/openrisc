		  OpenRISC Unified GNU Tool Chain Repository
		  ==========================================

This directory is where you will find all the source trees for the standard
GNU tool chain. The newlib library is included, since that is required for GCC
testing.

The structure mirrors that of the main Free Software Foundation repository.

Using a unified directory means that the entire tool chain can be built in a
single pass. The script "bld.sh" will build a unified source tree in the
directory "srcw" and then build and install all the tools using the directory
"bld-or32". Use "./bld.sh --help" to check the options available.

Any questions should be posted on the OpenRISC forum at
opencores.org/forum,OpenRISC.
